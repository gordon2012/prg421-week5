This assignment consists of two programs. They each have a method named atomic() and the first program, Concurrent.java, demonstrates how two threads can, sometimes, invoke atomic() concurrently. The second program, Nonconcurrent.java, demonstrates two threads that cannot invoke atomic concurrently.
